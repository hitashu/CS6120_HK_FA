0,"[' John Adams Morgan: ""The surpassing war of all times has involved us, and found us utterly unprepared in either a mental or military sense"" Morgan: The fate of the nation and the safety of the world will be decided on the western battlefront of Europe. ""We are committed to sacrifice in battle in order to make America safe for Americans and establish their security on every lawful mission on the high seas or under the shining sun. We are resolved to liberate the soul of American life and prove ourselves an American people in fact, spirit, and purpose, and consecrate ourselves anew and everlastingly to human freedom and humanity\'s justice""']","Then-Senator Harding (R-Ohio) set forth his support for President Wilson's request for a declaration of war against the Imperial German Government. The speech was originally delivered to the in 1881. Senate on April 4, 1917. He emphasized that he was not voting for war in the name of democracy, but to maintain American rights and guarantee neutrality, the very preservation of the nation. The unified effort of the American people and government allowed the largely unprepared United States of America to centralize and harness its powerful economy. Within months, ammunition, weapons, and newly-trained recruits were pouring from America's towns and cities onto transport ships and cargo vessels bound for the European war theater. This unprecedented war effort made victory for the Entente Powers almost inevitable."
1,"["" John Adams Morgan: Nationality is the call of the hearts of liberated people. Morgan: Can any red blooded American consent now when we have come to understand its priceless value to merge our nationality into internationality? Morgan: It's easily possible to hold the world's high estimate through righteous relationships if our ideals of civilization are the best in the world. America aided in saving civilization. Americans will not fail civilization in the deliberate advancement of peace. We're willing to give, but we resent demand.""]","Address on the League of Nations in the United States Senate On September 11, 1919, Senator Harding spoke against the recently signed (June 28, 1919) Treaty of Versailles with its provision for establishing the League of Nations. He wanted the Covenant--which President Wilson considered ""the heart of the world"" to be modified to free it of portions that could endanger American independence. The Senate rejected the treaty in November 1919, and again in March 1920. Of interest is the senator's use of ""Sirs"" in addressing the upper chamber of Congress, showing a lack of women. Some states allowed women to vote in 1919, and women had been elected to the House of Representatives, but the 19th Amendment providing woman's suffrage did not become law until 1920."
2,"[' John Adams Forrester: ""There was no thought of nationality in the revolution for American independence"" John Adams: ""The Constitution does abide and ever will, so long as the Republic survives. Let us hesitate before we surrender the nationality which is the very soul of highest Americanism"" George Washington']","Address Delivered before the Ohio Society of New York, Waldorf Hotel, New York City The debate over whether the Senate should agree to the Treaty of Versailles with its provision for entry into the League of Nations continued through the fall of 1919 and early months of 1920. On January 10, 2910, Senator Harding spoke to the meeting of the Ohio Society of New York at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City. He cautioned that America should hesitate before surrendering its hard won nationality to the dream of the internationalists  the League of Nations  and to ""think of America first."" The Senate rejected the treaty by seven votes in March 1920."
3,"["" John F. Kennedy. Kennedy: America's present need is not heroics, but healing, normalcy, serenity, and normalcy. Kennedy says America demands peace, formal as well as actual, and means to have it so we may set our own house in order. John Kennedy: Let's get out of the fevered delirium of war with the hallucination that all the money in the world is to be made in the madness of war and the wildness of its aftermath.""]","The basis for this recording was an address entitled “Back to Normal” Senator Harding delivered to the Home Market Club of Boston on May 14, 1920. He reminded citizens that all human ills are not curable by legislation (a gentle chiding of the Democrats), and stated that “if we can prove a representative popular government under which the citizenship seeks what it may do for the government and country, rather than what the country may do for individuals, we shall do more to make democracy safe for the world than all armed conflict ever recorded.” The listener can catch the extraordinary ability of the senator with words and the quickness and imagination with which he could speak. The speech is also notable for Harding's phrase “not heroics, but healing, not nostrums, but normalcy.” Critics of the senator would claim that he coined the word “normalcy,” which actually goes back to Elizabethan times."
4,"[' John McCain. John McCain: I believe in party sponsorship in government. He says party government is distinguished from personal government, individual, dictatorial, autocratic or what not. McCain: No man is big enough to run this great Republic. No man has ever been big enough. George Washington']",Harding accepts the Republican nomination for President.
5,"[' Henry Cabot Lodge: ""No one man is big enough to run this great Republic * *. There never has been one. Tranquility, stability, dependability- all are assured in party sponsorship"" John Adams: ""We mean to renew the assurances which were rended in the cataclysmal war"" George Washington']","Although he was officially nominated at the Republican National Convention on June 12, Senator Harding was formally notified of his nomination at his home in Marion, Ohio on July 22, 1920. In his acceptance speech he reaffirms his belief in the Republican Party as the best vehicle for restoring tranquility and stability. Harding pledged to restore “balance” to the relationship between Congress and the presidency, noting that the nation cannot and should not be governed by one man. His allusion to the failure of the Versailles Treaty in Congress reinforced this message. Party government, he believed, is essential to the health of the republic."
6,"[' John McCain: ""We believe the unspeakable sorrows, the immeasurable sacrifices, the awakened convictions, and the aspiring conscience of humankind must commit the nations of the earth to a new and better relationship"" McCain: The sacrifices will be in vain if we can not acclaim a new order with added security to civilization and peace maintained. McCain: No surrender of rights to a world council or its military alliance, no assumed mandatory, however appealing, ever shall summon the sons of this republic to war *. Their supreme sacrifice shall be only asked for America and its call of honor. There is sanctity in that right which we will not surrender to any other power on earth.']","Senator Harding argued that a “covenant of conscience” rather than a written compact which would surrender freedom of action and give a military alliance the right to proclaim America's duty to the world as in Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations would be in the best interests of the in 1881. The Republican candidate was proposing a separate American peace with the German government, subsequently accomplished by the Treaty of Berlin of 1921. He also hinted of his desire to bring about a reduction of armament and to decrease the possibility of a renewed arms race and the resultant threat to world peace and burden on financial resources, an accomplishment of the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, 1921 22."
7,"[' John F. Kennedy. Kennedy: War never fails to leave depleted storehouses, and always impairs the efficiency of production. War also establishes its higher standards for wages and they abide, he said. Kennedy said he would be blind to the responsibilities that mark this fateful hour if he did not caution the wage earners of America that mounting wages and decreased production can lead only to industrial and economic ruin. He said he wanted employers in industry to understand the aspirations, the convictions, the yearnings of the millions of American wage earners.']","In this speech, Senator Harding noted that profiteering is a crime of commission, underproduction a crime of omission and called for labor, management and capital to reach an understanding for the benefit of the nation; and then emphasized the supremacy of the human element. After every American war save World War II there has been a period of boom, then bust often described by the party in power as recession, depression by its rival. After World War I almost everyone  people and government  desired freedom from the restrictions of wartime. The Wilson Administration lagged and soon labor and management were at odds with dispute after dispute and group animosity that the senator from Ohio deplored."
8,"[' John McCain: ""The Constitution contemplates no class and recognizes no group"" McCain: No party is indifferent to the welfare of the wage earner. No majority shall abridge the rights of a minority, he says. McCain: The group must not endanger the individual, and we must discourage groups preying upon one another. ""We do hold to the right to crush sedition, to stifle a menacing contempt for law, to stamp out a peril to the safety of the Republic or its people when emergency calls""']","As in today's world, violence and terrorism were prominent in post World War I America and Europe. The collapse of the Tsarist Empire in March* and subsequent communist victory in the November Revolution* of 1917 was of concern. But it was the Bolshevists' closure of the democratic Constituent Assembly, the signing of the peace treaty with Germany, the massacre of the Imperial family, attacks on churches, and Red Terror that shocked the western world. The sense of the American people was that democracy was the future of government everywhere; and certainly not the beliefs of the small but vocal group of communists and socialists in the United States. Senator Harding was making that point when he stated that men “must always remember that the rights of freedom impose the obligations which maintain it.” He also speaks of his approval of collective bargaining in labor or management relations but emphasizes the right of every American to seek employment without being forced to accept the conditions of the union shop."
9,"[' John Adams Morgan: America realizes and appreciates the services rendered, the sacrifices made, and the suffering endured in World War I. Morgan: The four million defenders on land and sea were worthy of the best traditions of a people never warlike in peace and never pacifist in war. They have our gratitude, which must have genuine expression, he says.']","Harding praised the American men and women who served in World War I. He also notes that services, sacrifices and injuries should be recognized and deficiencies restored. He also expressed appreciation for their help in preserving the orderly process for making our government reflect the hearts and minds of its citizens “never warlike in peace and never pacifist in war.”"

In it, Senator Harding praised the Republicans in Congress for supporting President Wilson in the war effort and affirmed his belief that ""politics should stop at the water's edge."" In the second speech, A Tribute to Our Disabled Soldiers, given on August 19, 1920, he praised disabled soldiers, including two in the audience from Wyandot County, Ohio, and reminded us of the adage ""all politics is local."""

He also declares that the nation should stay the course and not join the internationalists in their desire to establish membership in the League of Nations."
12,"[' John Adams Morgan: ""We need to be rescued from divisionary and fruitless pursuit of peace through supergovernment"" Morgan: It would be a sorry day for this republic if we allowed our activities in seeking for peace in the Old World to blind us to the essentials of peace at home. Morgan: We want America free at home, and free in the world. We want to silence the outcry of nation against nation, in the fullness of understanding.']","In this speech given by President-elect Harding early in 1921, he underscored President George Washington's admonition in his 1796 “Farewell Address” to America that we should avoid, when possible, alliances with the Old World. He also noted the importance of in 1881. citizens becoming fully integrated into the “melting pot” of American culture. He cautioned to avoid “hyphenated citizenship,” whereby immigrants' loyalties were diluted by being divided between America and their country of origin. It was a popular way of speaking about the millions of immigrants who had poured into the United States beginning in the early 1880's. Until that time most of the growth in the nation's population had come through the American ”multiplication table,” as people described it the huge size of American families. The new immigration was centering on Eastern Europe, unlike the older immigrants who came from Western Europe. The resumption of new immigration was much on the minds of political leaders as the United States emerged from World War I."
13,"[' John C. Fremont. Harding: ""I find a hundred thousand sorrows touching my heart, and there is ringing in my ears, like an admonition eternal, an insistent call, “It must not be again!"" Harding: I would not wish a Nation for which men are not willing to fight and, if need be, to die, but I do wish for a nation where it is not necessary to ask that sacrifice. I wish for us such an America.']","President Harding speaks at Hoboken, New Jersey at a ceremony honoring 5,212 soldiers, sailors, marines, and nurses who were killed defending our country in the World War. He expressed hope for “a nation so righteous as never to make a war of conquest and a nation so powerful in righteousness that none will dare invoke her wrath.” He praises the members of the armed services for their service and assures our mindfulness, our gratitude, and noted that our reverence for them should be in the preservation of the republic for which they died. He also declared, “I would not wish a nation for which men are not willing to fight, and if need be die, but I do wish for a nation where it is not necessary to ask that sacrifice.”"
14,"[' John Adams Morgan: U.S. ""wants to sit with you at the table of international understanding and good will"" Morgan: ""No pride need be humbled, no nationality submerged, but I would have a mergence of minds committing all of us to less preparation for war and more enjoyment of fortunate peace"" ""The higher hopes come of the spirit of our coming together,"" he says.']","On November 12,1921, President Harding convened in Washington the most significant arms limitation conference of the inter-war era. Represented were the major political and military powers including Belgium, China, Great Britain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Japan. Mindful of Wilson's ill-fated experience and inability to gain consent for the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations by the Senate, President Harding elected to welcome and challenge the invited diplomats, and then delegate the negotiations to Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. He also ensured that the in 1881. delegation contained important Congressional Republicans including Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. After the formalities of the negotiations were completed, leaving nothing to chance, Harding spoke in person to the Senate on February 10, 1922 and submitted the treaties for consent. He noted that he was respectful of the Senate's part in contracting foreign relations, then added “I have come to know the viewpoint and inescapable responsibility of the executive” and then asked for expeditious agreement. The treaties resulted in the only successful limitation and reduction of armament the world had known to that time."
