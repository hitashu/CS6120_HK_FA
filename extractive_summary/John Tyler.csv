1,"[' John Adams Morgan: I feel myself constrained by the duty faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States. Morgan: It is a power which ought to be most cautiously exerted, and perhaps never except in a case eminently involving the public interest or one in which the oath of the President, acting under his convictions, both mental and moral, imperiously requires its exercise. He must either exert the negative power intrusted to him by the Constitution chiefly for its own preservation, protection, and defense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude.']","President Tyler vetoes a second bill for the establishment of a National Bank of the United States.  As a result of this veto, Tyler's entire Cabinet resigned, with the exception of Secretary of State Daniel Webster."
2,"[' Alexander McLeod, a British subject who was indicted for the murder of an American citizen, has been acquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury, and has under the judgment of the court been regularly discharged. In Great Britain a power exists in the Crown to cause to be entered a nolle prosequi. upon a prosecution pending in a State court, yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge. John Adams']","In his address to Congress, Tyler describes the result of the Caroline steamboat incident and discusses the repression of the African slave trade. The President also provides updates on the Indian war in Florida and reports on finances and tariffs."
3,"[' George Washington dispatch to U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The season for active hostilities in Florida having nearly terminated, my attention has necessarily been directed to the course of measures to be pursued hereafter in relation to the few Indians yet remaining in that Territory. Their number is believed not to exceed 240, of whom there are supposed to be about 80 warriors, or males capable of bearing arms. The further pursuit of these miserable beings by a large military force seems to be as injudicious as it is unavailing. It is believed by the distinguished officer in command there that a different system should now be pursued to attain the entire removal of all the Indians in Florida.']","Tyler recommends ending the costly, ineffective military efforts against the Indians in the region and enabling the settlers in the region to defend themselves if necessary."
4,"[' John Adams Forrester. The treaty will settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America. It will terminate a difference respecting boundary which has been the subject of several ineffectual attempts at settlement, and has sometimes led to great irritation, not without danger of disturbing the existing peace. The line agreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of Halls Stream and thence down that river, embracing the whole claim of New Hampshire and establishing her title to 100,000 acres of territory more than she would have had by the decision of the King of the Netherlands.']","President Tyler addresses the Senate on recent negotiations with Britain. The signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty with Great Britain on August 9, 1842 normalized in 1881.-British relations by adjusting the Maine-Brunswick border, settling boundary issues around western Lake Superior, and resurveying numerous smaller borders."
