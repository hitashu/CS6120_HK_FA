He will be my first care to administer the government in the true spirit of that instrument, and to assume no powers not expressly granted or clearly implied in the terms of the Constitution. The government of the United States is one of delegated and limited powers, and it is by a strict adherence to the clearly granted powers and by abstaining from the exercise of doubtful or unauthorized implied powers that we have the only sure guaranty against the recurrence of those unfortunate collisions between the federal and state authorities which have occasionally so much disturbed the harmony of our system']","With frequent references to the Union's growth in size, population, and strength, President Polk speaks at length about domestic issues.
