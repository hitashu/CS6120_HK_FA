No assessment for political purposes on officers or subordinates should be allowed. This rule is applicable to every department of the civil service. It should be understood by every officer of the General Government that he is expected to conform his conduct to its requirements. Very respectfully, R.B.']","Following John Jay's investigation of the New York Customhouse, Hayes issues this Executive Order, which forbids the involvement of federal employees in political activities. The President takes such action in the hope that it will curtail corruption; the Executive Order stipulates that those in office can no longer be dismissed for political reasons. These events testify to Hayes's interest in civil service reform."
1,"[' Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, issued the proclamation on July 18, 1877. The proclamation was issued in response to domestic violence in West Virginia. Hayes warned those involved in the violence to disperse and retire to their respective abodes within a limited time. He also warned all Americans against aiding, countenancing, abetting, or taking part in such unlawful proceedings.']","President Hayes sends federal troops to protect mail and quell the riots that take place in numerous cities as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.  Following pay cuts, the strike begins on the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) line at Camden Junction, Maryland; additional strikes will follow, lasting a month. Lacking organization, the strikes frequently degenerate into mob activity. The strike will lead to anti-Chinese attacks in San Francisco during the fall."
2,"[' Bill would make silver dollar legal tender for debts contracted when law did not recognize such coins as lawful money. Silver dollar authorized by this bill is worth 8 to 10 per cent less than it purports to be worth. Bill will be justly regarded as a grave breach of the public faith to undertake to pay these bonds, principal or interest, in silver coin worth in the market less than the coin received for them. Bill would put an end to the receipt of revenue in gold, and thus compel the payment of silver for both the principal and interest of public debt.']","President Hayes vetoes the Bland Allison Act, advocated by farmers and debtors, but Congress passes the measure over his veto. The act calls for the resumption of silver coinage at a rate between $2 and $4 million per month."

4,"[' Bill would provide for appropriations for support of Army for fiscal year ending June 30, 1880. Bill includes further legislation that involves questions of the gravest character. Bill is amendatory of the statute now in force in regard to the authority of persons in the civil, military, and naval service of the United States. This statute was adopted February 25, 1865, after a protracted debate in the Senate, and almost without opposition in the House of Representatives. Bill omits from both of the foregoing sections the words “or to keep the peace at the polls.”']","Congress passes the Army Appropriations Bill, which includes a ""rider"" forbidding the use of federal troops at polls. Many regard this as an attempt to nullify black voting rights and Hayes vetoes the bill, but the House sustains the veto. Hayes again vetoes the rebuffed version, and many Republicans feel the veto secures the election of 1880."

Constitution and laws. Hayes is also concerned that this bill subordinates the National Government to State authority and supervision."
6,"[' Bill would repeal or amend sections of the Revised Statutes of the United States. It would also repeal section 5522 of the criminal statutes of the U.S., which was enacted for the protection of officers engaged in the discharge of duties at Congressional elections. The supervisors will be left with the authority to observe and witness the proceedings at the Congressional elections, but will not be able to make arrests or to perform other duties than to be in the immediate presence of the officers holding the election and to witness all their proceedings, including the counting of the votes and the making of a return thereof.']","President Hayes vetoes a version of the appropriations bill for the third time. On June 23, Hayes votes a later bill, which excludes ""certain judicial expenses"" forbidding the army to ""police the polls.""

Letter asks for copies of all correspondence between the U.S. and foreign governments since February 1869 on the subject of a ship canal between North America and South America. George Washington Post: George Washington']","In this speech to the Senate, President Hayes continues to support a Central American canal to unite the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Following the trip to America by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps -- the builder of the Suez Canal in Egypt -- Hayes states that ""the policy of this country is a canal under American control."""
8,"[' John Adams Morgan. Morgan: The importance of the passage at the present session of Congress of a suitable measure for the refunding of the national debt which is about to mature is generally recognized. The section of the bill before me which relates to the national banking system, and to which objection is made, is not an essential part of a refunding measure. No new banks can be organized and no increase of the capital of existing banks can. be obtained except by the purchase and deposit of 3 per cent bonds. No other bonds of the United States can be used for the purpose. The average rate of taxation of capital employed in banking is more than double that of other legitimate business.']","Concerned that it will harm the national banking system, President Hayes vetoes a bill “to facilitate the refunding of the national debt.”"
